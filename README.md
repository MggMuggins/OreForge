# OreForge
Minecraft Mod that Reworks the Way Crafting Tools and Equipment Works

# Progress/Todo
Completed Gradle Forge build importing, as well as .gitignore. We need Lisence, README, and other documentation like that completed now. ALso learn Java, but you know...

# To Contribute:
To complete these steps, you will need the OpenJDK 8, Eclipse(or IntelliJ), Gradle, and Git.
1. Create a fork of this repository under your Github account
2. Clone your fork to your machine, in your eclipse workspace
3. Navigate to the repository directory in a terminal (Using <code>cd</code>)
4. Run <code>./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace</code> Then run <code>./gradlew eclipse</code>. (You can run the commands all at once by combining them like this: <code>./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace eclipse</code>) (on Windows, remove the <code>./<code> from the command) (If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, replace the <code>eclipse</code> keyword with <code>IDEA</code>)
5. Open up eclipse, and give it the path to your default workspace (or a directory level above wherever you cloned your fork)
6. In eclipse, use New > Project, and call it the name of your fork. It should change the dialouge box. Click OK for any other windows that pop up, and you should be good to go to start contributing! (A good tool to use with eclipse is egit, which can be found in the Cononical repository)
7. Either with egit or the command line version of git or using egit through Eclipse, commit your local changes to your local clone of your fork. Push those changes to your fork on Github. Then open a pull request to here. Make sure that your fork and local repo are up to date before you start editing!
